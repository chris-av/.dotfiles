# Neovim Configs

This is my config for neovim. It includes my preferred key mappings, global options, and packages. 

Make sure to put this in the proper folder: 

```
git clone git@github.com:chris-av/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## Acknowledgements
Big thanks to [ChrisAtMachine](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) for the excellent tutorials on how to set up the configs and he definitely inspired my project structure.
